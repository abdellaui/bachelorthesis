• Objective of the work and the delivered contribution to science
• Structure of the work




In outdoor scenarios, the mobile terminal positionis obtained with high accuracy thanks to the global positioningsystem (GPS) or to the standalone cellular systems. 

However, themain problem of GPS and cellular systems resides in the indoorenvironment and in scenarios with deep shadowing effects wherethe satellite or cellular signals are broken.


The sensors of image based camera localization are cameras. 


There occur many 3D camerasrecently. This paper only considers 2D cameras. 


The usually used tool for localization is GPSoutdoors. However, GPS cannot be used indoors. 

There are many indoor localization toolsincluding Lidar, UWB, WiFi AP et al, among which using cameras to localization is the mostflexible and low cost one. 

Autonomous localization and navigation is necessary for a movingrobot. 


To augment reality on images, the camera pose or localization are needed. 

To view virtual
environments, the corresponding viewing angle is necessarily computed. 


Furthermore, camerasare ubiquitous and people carry with their mobile phones that have cameras every day. 

Imagebased camera localization has great and wide applications.
